/**
 * The Edit buffer for the "Arrange apps" screen.
 *
 * Seeds the home order from the stored [HomePreferences], then lets the user edit a local copy so
 * nothing is persisted until [commit] (Back or Reset only touch this buffer). [order] and
 * [selected] are Compose state so the arrange UI re-renders as the user edits.
 *
 * Reordering is a selection mode: pressing Confirm on a focused app selects it ([selected]), then
 * Up/Down moves it through the order (or each row's arrows move that app directly). The dock is
 * never edited by hand — it is derived as the first [HomePreferences.DOCK_MAX] apps of [order],
 * so moving an app into/out of the top four automatically pins/unpins it.
